                    <p>There are so many places you could go to buy coffee. We've gone to extraordinary efforts to
                        ensure that <a href="index.html">SCAAL</a> is your best choice. The quality begins at harvest.
                    </p>
                    <p><a href="index.html">SCAAL</a> relies on selective picking, a labor-intensive process that
                        involves making several passes among the trees for those cherries that are perfectly ripe. Then
                        we select top grade SHB, which stands for strictly hard bean or strictly high grown. </p>
                    <p>Beans that are grown at a minimum altitude of 4,000 feet above sea level for optimum flavor.
                        Within hours of shipping our coffee to you, the beans are roasted on-site in small batches by a
                        Certified Roastmaster and vacuum-packed to retain its fresh taste and rich aroma. </p>
